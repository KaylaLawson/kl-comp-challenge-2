### KL Static-Comp-2 

The objective of the project was to re-create a website with responsiveness added and specs close to the composition.

Goal was to really grasp the concept of using grid within CSS. 

I feel I did get a good understanding however it took a while for things to click for me. 

I am still working on creating  media queries for the site. 

The svg circles were not working for me on the last comp so I decided to just recreate them with a what I can understand. They are not animated on load but I feel good about understanding the code. 

## Fun note: 

Please open in firefox. the circle graph, required for the project is not appearing in chrome.
