### KL Static-Comp-2 

The objective of the project was to re-create a website with responsiveness added and specs close to the composition.

Goal was to really grasp the concept of using grid within CSS. 

I feel I did get a good understanding however it took a while for things to click for me. 

I am still working on creating and efficient site so media queries can be used less. 

Challenges was getting fixated on things that didnâ€™t need fixating.
